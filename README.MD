## For Developers

**Anvil and Arcana** is built with **TypeScript** and uses **Vite** for module bundling and development. There are two Vite configuration files:

- **`vite.config.prod.js`**: This configuration is used for production builds. It ensures the final script is minimized for optimal performance in a live environment.
- **`vite.config.js`**: This configuration is used for development, providing a faster and more flexible environment for building and testing changes.

The module is distributed in its **ready-to-use** form in the releases section, so players and Game Masters can install and use it directly. However, for those who wish to modify or rebuild the module, Node.js is required to run the build process.

To rebuild the module, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that **Node.js** is installed on your system.
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To build the module, use:
   ```bash
   npx vite build
   ```
This will compile the TypeScript code according to the production configuration. The final output will be located in the `/dist` folder, ready for deployment.
